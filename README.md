# üîê JWT Authentication Demo

A comprehensive React + Node.js demo showcasing secure JWT authentication with device-specific sessions, OAuth integration, and production-ready security features.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Password-based and OAuth (Google, Microsoft, Strava, Company)
- **Device-Specific Sessions**: Each device gets unique token chains with session management
- **Proactive Token Refresh**: Automatic background refresh prevents expiration interruptions
- **Production Security**: Token blacklisting, CSRF protection, enhanced JWT claims
- **Full OAuth 2.0**: Authorization Code Flow with OpenID Connect support

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start all services (frontend, backend, oauth-server)
npm run dev
```

Access: http://localhost:3000 | Login: `demo` / `password123`

## üêõ Exploring with VS Code Debugger (Recommended)

Enable breakpoints with find and replace:

1. **Open VS Code** in the project root
2. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+H` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+H` (Mac)** to open Find & Replace across files
3. **Enable Regex mode** by clicking the `.*` button
4. **Find**: `^\s*// debugger;`
5. **Replace**: `debugger;`
6. **Click "Replace All"** to uncomment all debugger statements

Start debugging by pressing **F5** or using VS Code's debug panel:

- Select **Debug Full Stack** to launch oauth-server, backend and frontend with debugging enabled
- Access: http://localhost:3000
- Choose any login method and learn through breakpoints in documented code

See [debugging guide](docs/debugging.md) for comprehensive debugging instructions.
