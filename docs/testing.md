# Testing Guide

This project uses a comprehensive testing strategy with both unit tests and end-to-end integration tests.

## Test Overview

### Unit Tests (114 tests)

- **Backend**: 56 tests covering token utils, OAuth utils, refresh token store, and auth flows
- **OAuth Server**: 58 tests covering authorization store and configuration

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end Playwright tests covering complete OAuth and password authentication flows

### Continuous Integration

All tests run automatically on every push/PR to the main branch via GitHub Actions CI.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all project dependencies including test frameworks
npm run install:all
```

### 2. Run All Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests (backend + oauth-server)
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

## What the Test Does

The integration test performs a complete end-to-end OAuth authentication flow:

1. **üåê Opens the application** at http://localhost:3000
2. **üîê Clicks Google OAuth login button**
3. **‚úÖ Approves authentication** on the mock OAuth server
4. **üë• Navigates to Users page** to verify protected route access
5. **üìä Navigates to Sessions page** to verify another protected route
6. **üö™ Logs out** and verifies logout completed successfully

## Unit Tests

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests (backend + oauth-server)
npm run test:unit

# Run backend tests only
npm run test:unit:backend

# Run oauth-server tests only
npm run test:unit:oauth
```

### Unit Test Coverage

**Backend Tests (56 tests)**

- **Token Utils** (7 tests): JWT creation, claims validation, expiration
- **OAuth Utils** (8 tests): State encoding/decoding, round-trip integrity
- **Refresh Token Store** (27 tests): Token storage, retrieval, revocation, cleanup
- **Auth Flow** (14 tests): Login, protected routes, token refresh, sessions, logout

**OAuth Server Tests (58 tests)**

- **Authorization Store** (42 tests): Code storage, retrieval, expiration, multi-provider support
- **Config** (16 tests): Server settings, provider configurations, scopes validation

## Integration Test Modes

### Standard Mode

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Runs tests headlessly with automatic service startup.

### CI Mode

```bash
npm run test:integration:ci
```

Runs tests with list reporter (no HTML server) - used in GitHub Actions CI.

### Debug Mode

```bash
npm run test:integration:debug
```

Step through tests with debugger - perfect for troubleshooting.

### Headed Mode

```bash
npm run test:integration:headed
```

See the browser actions in real-time - watch the OAuth flow happen.

### UI Mode

```bash
npm run test:integration:ui
```

Interactive test runner with timeline, screenshots, and network logs.

## Architecture

The test coordinates three services:

- **Frontend** (React): Port 3000
- **Backend** (Express API): Port 3001
- **OAuth Server** (Mock): Port 3002

All services start automatically when you run the tests.

## Troubleshooting

### Ports Already in Use

If you get port conflicts:

```bash
# Kill any existing processes
lsof -ti:3000,3001,3002 | xargs kill -9
```

### Service Startup Issues

Tests wait 30 seconds for services to start. If they fail:

1. Check all dependencies are installed: `npm run install:all`
2. Try running services manually: `npm run dev`
3. Check the health endpoints:
   - http://localhost:3000 (should show React app)
   - http://localhost:3001/api/health (should return `{"status":"ok"}`)
   - http://localhost:3002/health (should return `{"status":"ok"}`)

### OAuth Flow Issues

If OAuth flow fails:

1. Run in headed mode to see what's happening: `npm run test:integration:headed`
2. Check screenshots in `integration-tests/test-results/`
3. Verify OAuth server is properly mocking Google OAuth

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing on every push/PR to the main branch.

### CI Pipeline

The CI runs the following jobs in parallel:

1. **Lint**: ESLint + Prettier code quality checks
2. **Build**: Builds all services (backend, oauth-server, frontend)
3. **Unit Tests**: Runs all 114 unit tests (56 backend + 58 oauth-server)
4. **Integration Tests**: Runs Playwright E2E tests
5. **Security Audit**: npm audit on all packages

### Scheduled Runs

CI also runs automatically every Monday at midnight UTC to catch dependency issues.

### CI Configuration

See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) for the complete CI configuration.

## Test Results

### Unit Tests

After running unit tests:

- View results in the terminal
- All tests must pass (exit code 0)

### Integration Tests

After running integration tests, check:

- **Screenshots**: `integration-tests/test-results/`
- **Videos**: Available on test failures
- **HTML Report**: Generated automatically by Playwright (use `:ci` mode to skip)
- **Artifacts**: Uploaded to GitHub Actions on CI runs
